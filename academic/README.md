# Academic work for HOT

At the 6. of june 2020 handcraft objects tool was presented to the mentor of the project, Erlend Raa VÃ¥gset, and an internal sensor from the informatics department at the university of Bergen. This project received a passing grade (it is only possible to either pass or fail in INF219), 

In this folder the presentation [[google sheets](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/150RRxwIO9859hR6xzNgOIs3nXag60A6MvsvUWu_PNZE/edit?usp=sharing ), [pptx](INF219_presentasjon.pptx), [pdf](INF219_presentasjon.pdf)] (in norwegian) and a white paper [[pdf](INF219_paper.pdf)] (in english) can be found. 

In addition to this a partial diary (in norwegian) of the early parts of the project can be found [here](INF219_dagbok.pdf). It contains how much and when work was done and includes git commit ids if you're really interested looking at a specific date. It ends with the recursion battle, but I won't spoil that.
